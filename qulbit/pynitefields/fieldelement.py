class FieldElement():
    """ Class for an element in a finite field.

        Args:
            p (int): The prime order of the field this element is in.
            n (int): The degree of the field extension for the field this 
                     element is in.
            exp_coefs (list): The set of expansion coefficients of this element
                              in terms of some basis.
            field_list (list of FieldElements) - A copy of the list of all 
                     elements in the GaloisField this element is in. Empty when
                     the elements are initially constructed, and filled later
                     by the constructor of GaloisField. Inclusion 
                     of this parameter is not ideal, but greatly simplifies the 
                     implementation of many of the arithmetic operations 
                     (notably multiplication, inverse, exponentiation),
                     specifically for power of prime fields. With field_list, 
                     each element always knows its position, or power of the 
                     primitive element in the field. I'm not proud of it being
                     implemented this way, but this is the best I can do now.

        Attributes:
            p (int): The prime order of the field this element is in.

                     element is in.
            dim (int): The dimension of the field, :math:`p^n`.
            prim_power (int): This element represented as a power of the 
                              primitive element of the field.
            exp_coefs (list): The set of expansion coefficients of this element
                              in terms of the polynomial basis.
            is_sdb (bool): Indicates whether this element is expressed in
                           the self-dual basis or not. False by default.
            sdb_coefs (list): The set of expansion coefficients in the self-
                              dual basis. Empty by default.
            str_rep (string): A representation of the exp_coefs as a string.
            field_list (list of FieldElements) - A copy of the list of all 
                     elements in the GaloisField this element is in.
